>Amazon home page amazon.com is launched using a few hundred microservices.  Explain the concept of the Amazon 
two-pizza team concept which Amazon contends is the ideal that made Amazon migration from monolith application 
successful. Why was this initially successful and why the use of cloud was required as well.


I decided to do my final presentation on this prompt because I think that Amazon is a fascinating company. They 
have such a broad reach yet manage to not overextend. I think that examing their transition from a monolothic
structure will be a very fruitful exercise. It seems likely to me that their own experience in transitioning to
the cloud likely led to their massive success with AWS. Overall from this assignment I hope to learn more about
both modern tech businesses and microservices.
