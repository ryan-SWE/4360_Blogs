**_The Cloud and Microservices_**

The cloud is perhaps the ideal place for microservices. Cloud services themselves are already set-up similarly to microservices, where you have a number of smaller services interconnected with one another. For example, this allows you to have a virtual machine setup on an EC2 instance on AWS connected to a storage bucket setup separately. A user can then update their processing capabilities without touching their storage, or vice versa. This extends to all the other services hosted in the cloud, allowing for easy scalability and maintenance. 

With microservices, smaller more frequent updates are common. The cloud is well suited for faster deployment of frequent updates. When first setting up microservices, the implementation can be rather tricky. By working with a platform that is natively designed for smaller, interconnected components, it should be easier to get things to work together correctly.
